## Hl2-Lambda
This script tells you which Lambda Caches you still need to get for the "Lambda Locator" achievement.

## Attribution
This script was originally created as a GitHub Gist by huntfx. His original script can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/huntfx/ba8ddhttps://gist.github.com/huntfx/ba8dde26845f7eb4f5dd604d5200d709e26845f7eb4f5dd604d5200d709).
I have updated the script with more QOL features as well as updating it to work with the 20th Anniversary update to the game, which broke the original code.

## How to use
Requires Python and Git.
- Clone the repo in a terminal: ``git clone https://github.com/NorthernChicken/hl2_lambda``, enter the new directory ``cd hl2_lambda``
- Run the script with ``python hl2_lambda``
